## Getting Started

The school material is a collection of Jupyter notebooks, organized in one
folder per subject. The data are also provided in the repository. You can view
and use the material by either:
* Installing the package (see "Installing" below)
* Manually downloading the material and use it (see "Downloading without
  installation" below)

## Installing

The environment is based on Python 3.12 and all packages are installed via `pip`
using a `conda` environment.

### Clone the repository

First, clone the repository and enter the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/astrostatistics-in-crete/2025_summer_school.git
cd astrostat25_summer_school
```

### Create the conda environment

Make sure you have Miniconda or Anaconda installed.

Then, create the environment using the provided environment.yml file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a new environment named "astrostat25" with Python 3.12, and
install all required packages via pip.

### Activate the environment

Once created, activate the environment with:

```bash
conda activate astrostat25
```

## Register the kernel with Jupyter

After activating the environment, register it as a Jupyter kernel so it can be
used in notebooks or in VSCode:

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=astrostat25 --display-name="astrostat25"
```

This will make "astrostat25" appear as an available kernel in both the
Jupyter interface and the VSCode Python kernel selector.

### Launch Jupyter Notebook

You can now start the notebook interface from inside the environment:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Downloading without installation

If you prefer not to install the environment locally, you can still access and
view the notebooks with the methods listed below.

> NOTE: Interactive figures (e.g., Plotly, ipywidgets) may not display as intended.

### 1. View notebooks directly on GitHub

GitHub natively renders `.ipynb` files as static HTML. Simply navigate to any
notebook file in the repository to view its contents.

> NOTE: Some figures are embedded in the notebooks, so they will only be visible
when the notebooks are downloaded and opened locallyâ€”they will not be displayed
on GitHub.

### 2. Use the "Open in nbviewer" browser extension

For a quick inspection, you can install a browser extension that allows you to
open Jupyter Notebooks directly in your browser:

- [Jupyter Notebook Viewer for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jupyter-notebook-viewer/ocabfdicbcamoonfhalkdojedklfcjmf)
- [Python Notebook Viewer for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/python-notebook-viewer/)

After installing the extension, simply open a `.ipynb` file in your browser to
view it rendered as a notebook.
